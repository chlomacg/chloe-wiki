<h4 id="10-the-structure-of-a-brevis-program">1.0: The structure of a Brevis program</h4>
<p>Brevis programs are made of three things: bindings, expressions, and types. Bindings state a fact that modifies the namespace of the program within a given scope, while expressions do not, and evaluate to a value. Expressions with side-effects can be written, as Brevis is an impure functional language, but they always contain a value, even if that value is of the <code>void</code> type.</p>
<h5 id="11-bindings">1.1: Bindings</h5>
<p>Currently, the only binding implemented in the Brevis compiler is the <code>let</code> binding. Let bindings take the form of <code>let var: type</code>, or <code>let var: type = val</code>, for assignment at declaration.</p>
<p><small>Note: types for bound names can be written out, but in nearly every case, the type of a variable can be inferred.</small></p>
<h5 id="12-expressions">1.2: Expressions</h5>
<p>Expressions look mostly like what you would expect. As of current, the expressions supported by the compiler are literals, identifiers, blocks, lambdas, if-expressions, unary expressions, binary expressions, and function calls.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Literals represent pieces of data known at compile time. Currently supported are string literals, integer literals, and floating-point literals, represented as <code>&quot;string&quot;</code>, <code>42</code>, and <code>3.14</code>, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identifiers are just variables, and are written how one might expect. <code>x</code> for a variable named x, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Blocks represent the sequencing of operations and data. Blocks are written as lines within curly braces, separated with semicolons, and contain the value of their last line. Because the &quot;lines&quot; in blocks can contain either bindings or expressions, the value of a block may, or may not, be void. As an example, the expression <code>{ f(); g(); 5 }</code> has the type <code>int</code>, and a value of 5, but f and g are still run before returning the value, because Brevis is an eagerly-evaluated language.<br><br><small>Note: the last semicolon in a block is optional, but, stylistically, if the last line has a void value, include the semicolon as a visual marker.</small></p>
</li>
<li><p>Lambdas represent anonymous functions, are first-class expressions, and are written in the form <code>fn(arg1, arg2, arg3) expr</code>, where expr is the return value of the function. The return type is usually inferred, but it can be explicitly stated with the syntax <code>fn(arg1, arg2, arg3)(t<sub>return</sub>) expr</code>. As a more clear example, a function that returns the value passed to it would be written as <code>fn(x) x</code>, or, as is stylistically preferred, <code>fn(x){ x }</code>. Note that there is no separate syntax for declaring named functions; if a named function is wanted, a let binding can be used to bind the function to a name like any other value might be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If-expressions take the form <code>if condition { then_expr } else { else_expr }</code>, where the the value of the whole expression is either then-expr, or else-expr, depending on the condition. If the value of the then-expr is void, or unused, no else-expression is needed, but otherwise, the types of the branches <em>must</em> agree.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unary expressions represent the application of a unary operator on an expression. There are only two unary operators: the boolean not operator, <code>!</code>, and the numerical negation operator, <code>-</code>. Unary operators are written in prefix notation, like in most languages, i.e. <code>!condition</code> and <code>-x</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Binary expressions represent the application of a binary operator on an expression, and are written in traditional infix notation. Below is a table of the currently available operators, the types they apply to, and their behavior. Custom binary operators are not implemented, but are being considered, despite my better judgement.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Calls are written as in the C family of languages, i.e. <code>f(x)</code> or <code>g(4, 5)</code>, where the value of the expression is the value computed in the callee function. Variadic functions are not supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="13-types">1.3: Types</h5>
<p>The primitive types in Brevis are <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>string</code>, and <code>void</code>, which represent booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and the abscence of a value, respectively. Functions have types dependent on the types of their arguments, and their return type, and are written in the following style: <code>fn(t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>)(t<sub>return</sub>)</code>. For a function, say, <code>fn(x, y) { x + y + 1 }</code>, the type of the function is <code>fn(int, int)(int)</code>. Structures, unions, tuples, and generic types are not yet implemented, making functions the only type constructors in Brevis at the moment.</p>
<h4 id="20-recursion">2.0: Recursion</h4>
<p>Brevis has a few guaranteed optimizations to make the language more usable, one of which is tail-call optimization, or TCO. TCO makes tail-recursive calls - calls at the end of a function - equivalent to a <code>goto</code>, meaning that no frames need to be pushed onto the stack during recursion, resulting in no stackoverflows from recursion depth. As for recursive non-tail-calls, those are not optimized, and a warning is issued for them.</p>
