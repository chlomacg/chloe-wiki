			Brevis: Introduction
		</h1>
		<h3>What is Brevis?</h3>
		<p>Brevis is a modern, portable language with clear and concise syntax, designed for writing in a functional style. It currently compiles to C and JavaScript, and has full support for type inference.</p>
		<h3>How is it different from other languages?</h3>
		<p>In its current form, Brevis is unique in that it has static types, performs type inference, has first-class functions, <i>and</i> compiles to C89, making it available even on systems without modern C compilers, such as Plan 9.</p>
		<p>Features to be added in the near future are closures, tail-call optimization, equality operator chaining, tuples, and algebraic datatypes. More complex features, such as generic functions, pattern matching, and macros, will be added within a year.</p>
		<h3>What makes it better than the competitors?</h3>
		<p>Due to the lack of language support for many of the systems Brevis is targeting, there aren't many competitors besides C itself. Some advantages Brevis has over C is support for anonymous functions, if-expressions, and type inference. Type inference alone is incredibly useful though, as it saves a lot of <i>typing</i>.</p>
