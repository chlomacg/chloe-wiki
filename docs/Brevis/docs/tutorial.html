				Brevis: Tutorial

		</header>
		<h4 id="brevis-tutorial">Brevis: Tutorial</h4>
<p>For this portion, we&#39;re going to rewrite some common programming patterns in Brevis, to get a feel for what the language is like. These will look very familiar to those who program in functional languages.</p>
<h5 id="hello-world">Hello World!</h5>
<pre><code>print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);</code></pre><p>There&#39;s really only thing that can be taken away from this, and it&#39;s that Brevis has no concept of a main function, and just exectutes cde line by line, similar to most scripting languages.</p>
<h5 id="for-loops">For-loops</h5>
<pre><code>let for_range = fn(low, high, f) {
    if low &lt;= high {
        f(low);
        for_range(low + 1, high, f)
    }
};</code></pre><p>This snippet shows how one might define looping mechanisms within the Brevis language. By making functions first-class and tail-call optimized, nice things like this are available for free.</p>
<h5 id="fizzbuzz">FizzBuzz</h5>
<pre><code>let fizzbuzz = fn(n) {
    let ret = &quot;&quot;;
    ret = ret ~ (if n % 3 == 0 { &quot;Fizz&quot; } else &quot;&quot;);
    ret = ret ~ (if n % 5 == 0 { &quot;Buzz&quot; } else &quot;&quot;);

    if ret == &quot;&quot; {
        itoa(n)
    } else {
        ret
    }
};

for_range(1, 100,
    fn(n) {
        print(fizzbuzz(n) ~ &quot;\n&quot;);
    }
);</code></pre><p>Not much to comment here, readers of this page are probably sick of this problem already. We use the <code>for_range</code> function defined in the previous snippet, because why have WET code when you can just not?</p>



<!---
		<h4>A simple program</h4>
		<code>print("hello world!");</code>
		<p>This doesn't show a lot about the language, except that Brevis has no concept of a "main function", it just executes line-by-line, similar to Python.</p>
		<h4>The (in)famous program</h4>
<pre><code>let fizzbuzz = fn(from, to) {
	let aux = fn(n, accumulator) {
		if (n % 3) == 0 {
			accumulator = accumulator ~ "Fizz";
		};
		if (n % 5) == 0 {
			accumulator = accumulator ~ "Buzz";
		};
		if (n % 3) != 0 and (n % 5) != 0 {
			accumulator = accumulator ~ itoa(n);
		};
		accumulator = accumulator ~ "\n";

		if n == to {
			accumulator
		} else {
			n =
				if n < to {
					n + 1
				} else {
					n - 1
				};
			aux(n, accumulator)
		}
	};

	aux(from, "")
};

print(fizzbuzz(1, 100));</code></pre>
		<p>This example shows more of Brevis' grammar. The fizzbuzz variable is declared to be a function literal that takes in two arguments, denoted by the `fn` keyword. Functions have no `return` keyword or equivalent, because function bodies are just expressions. In both the `aux` and `fizzbuzz` functions, the expression type is a "block" expression, of the form <code>{ line; line; value; }</code> where each line is executed sequentially, and the last line of the block is the value the block evaluates to. The `if` keyword denotes another kind of expression, of the form <code>if condition then-branch else else-branch</code>which evaluates to either the `then-branch`, or the `else-branch`, depending on the conditional. It is worth noting that although block expressions are commonly used in the branches of an if expression, any expression can be used as a branch value, so long as the type of the branches are the same. Therefore, the expression <code>if true and false 0 else 1</code> is, although not very readable, valid Brevis code.</p>
		<p>This implementation of FizzBuzz is fairy standard, but a few things might strike readers as odd. For one, this implementation is recursive, while most involve looping. This is because Brevis has no concept of looping. While that might sound limiting, recursion is able to capture the concept of looping, and maintains a functional, data-oriented approach to iteration.</p>
		<p>This implementation is also "tail-call" recursive, meaining that the only time the `aux` function calls itself is when it is at the end, or "tail", of its definition. This makes the function equivalent to a loop, which the Brevis compiler is able to recognize, and optimize. This makes tail-call recursive functions safe at any arbitrary depth of recursion, and as fast as loops, while maintaining a functional approach to programming.</p>
		<h4>The TPK algorithm</h4>
<pre><code>let sqrt = fn(num) {
	let aux = fn(n, root, precision) {
		if (root - n/root) < precision {
			root
		} else {
			aux(n, (root + n/root) / 2.0, precision)
		}
	};

	aux(num, num, 0.0001)
};

let pow = fn(n, exp) {
	if exp == 0 {
		1.0
	} else if exp == 1 {
		n
	} else {
		pow(n*n, exp-1)
	}
};

let abs = fn(x) {
	if x < 0.0 {
		-x
	} else {
		x
	}
};

let f = fn(t) {
	sqrt(abs(t)) + 5.0 * pow(t, 3)
};

let TPK = fn(n) {
	let val = f(n);
	print(ftoa(n) ~ " " ~
		(if val > 400.0 {
			"TOO LARGE"
		} else {
			ftoa(val)
		}) ~ "\n"
	);
};

TPK(3.0);</code></pre>

<pre><code>let for_range = fn(low, high, f) {
	if low <= high {
		f(low);
		for_range(low + 1, high, f);
	}
};

let print_factors = fn(n) {
	let factors_str = fn(sub_n, factor) {
		if (sub_n % factor) == 0 {
			itoa(factor)
		} else {
			""
		}
	};

	for_range(0, n,
		fn(sub_n) {
			let factors = factors_str(n, sub_n);
			factors = factors ~
					if sub_n != n and factors != "" { ", " } else "";
			print(factors);
		}
	);
};

print_factors(5120);
