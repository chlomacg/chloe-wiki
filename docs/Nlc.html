<p>I think I've stumbled across a way to build languages more portably by default than the traditional methods. The potential in this method's other benefits, such as full embedding-as-a-library, makes me quite excited for speedup of famously slow languages.</p>
<p>To explain what it is that I found, I have to explain a common pattern that I'd run into when developing compilers.</p>
<h4>So here's the scenario right</h4>
<p>I'm on system <strong>A</strong>, with language <strong>X</strong>, and want to make language <strong>Y</strong> available on <strong>A</strong>.</p>
<p>I write the bootstrap compiler in (or transpile it to) <strong>X</strong>, now <strong>Y</strong> is on <strong>A</strong>. I like to get things working before I get them working well, so the backend of this compiler usually is <strong>Y</strong> itself, rather than whatever assembly is on <strong>A</strong>. All well and good, but this is where the headache begins...</p>
<p>Now nine times out of ten, if I want a compiler for <strong>Y</strong>, I want a self-hosted compiler. But then I've ended up having to write two compilers for the benefits of one, and generally endured bootstrapping headaches. Why bootstrap at all? This led to a provocative question.</p>
<h3>What if we shrunk the compiler by building syntax in a metalanguage?</h3>
<p>This would certainly fix the problem at hand. Instead of &quot;building a compiler&quot; for language <strong>X</strong>, make a library in metalanguage <strong>M</strong> that implements the precedence and parsing, make a library that implements macros for the syntax to transform it into <strong>Y</strong>, and you're done!</p>
<p>No more <code>compiler-bootstrap</code> and <code>compiler</code> in <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong>, just two versions in <strong>M</strong>, one 100% in language <strong>X</strong>, and one mostly in language <strong>Y</strong>, with the rest being the implementation of <strong>Y</strong>, written in <strong>X</strong>.</p>
<p>Thinking about this led to more provocative questions, mostly centered around the idea of making a language not just portable, but downright pocket-able.</p>
<h3>Why not build syntax incrementally?</h3>
<h3>Why not write syntax in our code?</h3>
<h1>How small can the metalanguage be?</h1>
<p>and maybe even,</p>
<h1>Can we implement types in userspace?</h1>
<p>We'll talk about all of these.</p>
<p>These all had immediate problems, which I'll go though now, as if we were designing it together, and working through them one by one, before we talk about specific design.</p>
<h2>Problem 1: Now we have to deal with a metalanguage</h2>
<p>I know, not ideal. We'll settle by making it as small as possible. We'll decide now that only primitives for syntax-building are going to be included, whatever those look like.</p>
<h2>Problem 2: Writing syntax uses syntax</h2>
<p>On the one hand, it'd be nice to implement a language as a library. But how does one go about implementing the syntax? We need code that runs, and to write explicit parser code in userspace would put us right at square one.</p>
<p>Instead, we imagine a metalanguage where the compiler and programmer are in constant communication, with the programmer explicitly building some sort of parser throughout the metaprogram. I've thought of a few ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every time symbols are added, build an entire BNF tree. Metacompiler generates parser from BNF.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Problem 3: Imports require a clean namespace</h2>
<p>The whole idea with modular programming, imports, and code reuse is the assumption that one's namespace is kept clean, to prevent things like value, module, or type name clashes.</p>
<p>But we're not importing variable names here, it's much more inconvenient than that! We're importing <em>syntax</em> names, which means symbol clashes need to be resolved <em>before</em> the import, and symbols may contain several identifiers - think about the symbol <code>if{_}else{_}</code>. Let's work through some possible solutions here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you only use one language at a time? If you want to parse a section as another language, switch it fully, and leave the metalanguage's symbols behind?
<ul>
<li>Sadly, this would make so many usecases impossible that it just needs vetoed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe keep the metalanguage's symbols, but rename them if necessary?
<ul>
<li>This could work, but renaming symbols manually makes inter-op via embedding uses difficult and painful.</li>
<li>This would require at least one symbol to be used for changing the metalanguage's symbols, which does suck a bit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do we even need all of the metalanguage's symbols? At least some of the time that we import a language, we might really just want to use it, and return a value. No syntax building in the language imported, nor usage of other language. In that case, why have anything but the symbols to destroy and build syntax?</li>
</ul>
